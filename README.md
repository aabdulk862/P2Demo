# P2Demo!!

- JWT and Spring Security for auth, security, and password encryption on the backend

  - JWTs are JSON Web Tokens. They're a way to uniquely identify a logged in user, and send a payload containing their specific information. No more sessions!
  - Login and Register require no auth. Login creates and sends a JWT in the response
    - All other requests require a JWT in the Authorization Header of all requests
  - Check the Utils package and application.properties for the JWT and Spring Security configuration
    
- Context API for global storage on the front end (might not get to this sadly)
  - Stores the JWT, with all the relevant user info and for use in axios requests
 
- UUIDs instead of int IDs

- public deployment. RDS, EC2, S3.
  - Check LoginComponent and PetComponent to see our S3-hosted front ends making calls to our EC@-hosted backends
  - Check application.properties for RDS connection

- Dockerfile for the option to containerize the app
